The given code snippet applies various filters to a DataFrame. Here is a brief summary of the applied filters:

1. Replacement of missing years: The `replace_missing_years` function iterates over the "Year" column of the DataFrame and replaces the value 9999.0 with the previous and next valid year are the same. In one particular case where a value falls between 2018 and 2017, it is set to 2017 because the other features appear to be accurate.

2. Replacement of state abbreviations: The `replace_state_values` function is applied to the "State" column to replace the abbreviations of certain states with their full names.

3. Conversion of the "Length" column: The "Length" column is converted from a string format (e.g., "4-year") to a numeric format by removing the "-year" character and converting the resulting value to a float type.

4. Replacement of incorrect input values: The value 9999999.0 in the "Value" column is replaced with `pd.NA`.

5. Removal of rows with missing values: The `dropna` method is applied to remove rows that have missing values in the specified columns (required_features).

6. Saving the filtered DataFrame: The filtered DataFrame is exported to a CSV file named "Undergrad_filtered.csv".

The code snippet also prints out information about the filtered DataFrame, including the unique values and value counts for each column.
